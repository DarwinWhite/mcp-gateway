# [Open Source] MCP Gateway: A Centralized Hub for Managing Your Model Context Protocol Servers

Hey r/mcp!

I'm excited to share a new open-source project that might solve a pain point many of us are experiencing as we scale our MCP implementations: **MCP Gateway & Registry**.

## The Problem

As many of us have discovered, while MCP is revolutionizing how AI models connect with external tools and data sources, managing a growing collection of MCP servers quickly becomes challenging:

* **Discoverability issues**: Which servers are available? What tools do they offer?
* **Configuration headaches**: Constantly updating URLs in AI agents for different servers
* **Management overhead**: Tracking health and status across multiple independent servers
* **Inconsistent access patterns**: Different teams implementing different approaches

## The Solution: MCP Gateway & Registry

The MCP Gateway transforms your scattered MCP landscape into an organized, manageable ecosystem:

* **Single entry point** for all MCP traffic (both SSE and Streamable HTTP)
* **Centralized registry** with a web UI showing all available servers and their tools
* **Unified URL structure** (e.g., `gateway.mycorp.com/weather`, `gateway.mycorp.com/fininfo`)
* **Real-time health monitoring** with WebSocket updates
* **Dynamic configuration** that automatically updates routing rules

## Meta-Capability: Self-Management Through MCP

One of the coolest features is that the Gateway includes its own MCP server (`mcpgw`) that exposes management capabilities as MCP tools. This means AI agents can manage the Gateway directly through the MCP protocol!

Tools include:
* `toggle_service`: Enable/disable servers
* `register_service`: Add new servers programmatically
* `get_service_tools`: List all tools from specific or all servers
* And more!

## Tech Stack

* **Nginx** as a powerful reverse proxy
* **FastAPI** for the Registry application
* **Docker** for easy deployment
* **WebSockets** for real-time updates

## Getting Started

The project is designed for both quick proof-of-concept deployments and production-ready implementations. Check out the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/aarora79/mcp-gateway/tree/main) for detailed instructions.

## Roadmap

Future plans include:
* OAUTH 2.1 support
* Intelligent tool finder
* Deployment automation for MCP servers
* GitHub API integration
